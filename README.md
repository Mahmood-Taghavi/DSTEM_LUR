# d-stem-LUR
This is the companion repository for the paper titled "Concurrent Spatiotemporal Daily Land Use Regression Modeling and Missing Data Imputation of Fine Particulate Matter Using Distributed Space-Time Expectation Maximization". 
Currently, we have added the dataset and cleaned code to fit the final D-STEM kriging and D-STEM LUR models to the repository. We are going to add estimated pollution maps in upcoming updates.

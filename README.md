This is the companion repository for our paper titled "Concurrent Spatiotemporal Daily Land Use Regression Modeling and Missing Data Imputation of Fine Particulate Matter Using Distributed Space-Time Expectation Maximization". 
Currently, we have added the dataset to the repository. We are going to add the cleaned codes and also the estimated pollution maps in upcoming updates.
